Getting Started

Installing
----------

::

    npm install etherlime [-g]

Running embedded ganache-cli
----------------------------

For easier integration and usage of the upcoming
EtherlimeGanacheDeployer and running local deployments you can use the
embedded ganache-cli. It comes with fixed 10 accounts and a lot of eth
(191408831393027885698 to be precise)

::

    etherlime ganache

Setting up your project to deploy with etherlime
------------------------------------------------

::

    etherlime init

This will create ``deployment`` directory with ``deploy.js`` file
inside. You can use this file to write your deployment procedure.

In order to deploy using this file you can use the following file:

::

    etherlime deploy [file] [network]

Optionally you can use another file as long as you keep the structure of
the file (exporting an ``async deploy`` function with ``network``
param). You can also optionally provide a ``--network`` argument to be
passed to the deployer. It is up to you how to make sense of it.

The deployment process is verbose and gives you real-time info about the
performed actions. In addition there is a report of the actions when the
deployment finishes (as not all of us monitor the deployment process
constantly);

History of your deploys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to see a list of what you've deployed you can run the following
command:

::

    etherlime history [limit]

By default it returns the last 5 records but you can use the optional
``limit`` parameter to request less or more entries.
